Tested using Erlang 5.10.3 on Windows and Debian Linux. There is a convenient start script for Windows (`start.bat`) and Linux (`start.sh`) that compile the `src` folder to `ebin` and open a REPL with the application options displayed.

### Why Erlang? ###

I'm currently studying Erlang to learn functional programming. Also I'm quite amazed by Erlang's zero downtime deployments and (supposed) horizontal scaling due to the way it spawns processes and deals with (immutable) variables. I'm hoping to learn Erlang well and then rewrite [my site](http://mohammad.el-abid.com/) in Erlang.

### Can I fork/pull request/you did something wrong ###

Yes you may (and please do)! This is my first real Erlang application so there are a lot of things I might have done inefficiently since I don't fully understand the language/virtual-machine yet.

### Screenshots ###

Soon
